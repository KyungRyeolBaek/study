# This first line is provided for you

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
pay = input("Enter Pay:")

print("Pay:", float(hrs) * float(pay))

# 2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.

# Desired Output
# Pay: 96.25
